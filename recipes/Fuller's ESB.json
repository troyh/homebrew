"notes": "<p><a href=\"http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f12/fullers-esb-clone-229179/\">Homebrewtalk discussion</a></p>

<p>According to http://www.byo.com/component/resource/article/2398-fuller-s-the-pride-of-london, ESB is 5.9% ABV, 35 IBUs, an SRM of 15, an OG of 1.060 and an FG of 1.014.</p>

<p>I put the 1.5oz of dry-hop hops in the Blichmann HopRocket which was put inline between the brew kettle and the chiller to see how that affects the hop aroma.</p>

<p>I pitched a 1.2L starter because I didn't have enough time to cold-crash and decant. Not ideal. The yeast was also a 2nd generation from a previous batch of Fuller's ESB.</p>

<p>Dough-in at 161F.</p>
<p>Strike temp: 161F</p>
<p>Mash @ 154.5F > 153F > 151.4F > 151F</p>
<p>Boil volume was 6.8G @ 1.052</p>
<p>End of boil was 5.75G @ 1.060. Was supposed to be 1.062! >:-(</p>
